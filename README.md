Shikou Tree – a Thought Drift App
"Wandering is thinking. This app gives form to your hesitation."

🌱 What is this?

Shikou Tree is a minimalist thought-exploration tool.
It lets you visually branch your ideas by answering simple philosophical prompts like:

“Expand options?”

“Think deeper?”

“Use imagination?”

“Consider counterarguments?”

“Add new ideas?”

You can also click a 💬 Mayoi button ("迷い" = hesitation) for randomized philosophical nudges.

🧠 Why?

Because not knowing what to think is a sign of a living mind.
This app celebrates 迷い — a Japanese word for drifting thought, doubt, curiosity, and possibility.

It’s not made for productivity. It’s made for possibility.

🫣 Creator's Note

This was made as a creative experiment in embracing hesitation.
You're not lost. You're just wandering wisely.
